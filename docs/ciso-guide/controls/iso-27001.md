ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is the latest version of the international standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).
It provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive company information, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is structured around a risk-based approach, where organizations must identify and mitigate security risks through a set of well-defined **controls**.
These controls are detailed in **Annex A** and includes 93 controls categorized into four key themes:

1. **Organizational Controls (37 controls)** – Covering governance, policies, roles, and responsibilities, such as information security roles, supplier relationships, and threat intelligence.
1. **People Controls (8 controls)** – Focused on human factors, including security awareness training, screening, and disciplinary processes.
1. **Physical Controls (14 controls)** – Addressing physical security measures like access controls, equipment security, and environmental protections.
1. **Technological Controls (34 controls)** – Covering cybersecurity measures such as encryption, identity management, and network security.

Welkin can help your organization implement some of these control.
